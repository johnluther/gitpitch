# The Tools 

---
# Active Love

+++

1. Concentration: Feel your heart expand to encompass the world of infinite love surrounding you. When your heart contracts back to normal size, it concentrates all this love inside your chest.

2. Transmission: Send all the love from your chest to the other person, holding nothing back.

3. Penetration: when the love enters the other person, don't just watch, feel it enter; sense a oneness with them. Then relax and feel all the energy you gave away return to you.
